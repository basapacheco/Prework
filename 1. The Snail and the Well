1. Assign the challenge data to variables with representative names: well_height, daily_distance, nightly_distance and snail_position.

well_height
daily_distances
nightly_distance
snail_position
count_days

2. Create a variable days to keep count of the days that pass until the snail escapes the well.

well_height = 125
daily_distances = 30
nightly_distance = 20
snail_position = 0
count_days = 0

3. Find the solution to the challenge using the variables defined above.

while (snail_position < well_height):
  snail_position += daily_distances
  snail_position -= nightly_distance
  count_days +=1
print(count_days)

4. Print the solution.
print(count_days)

Bonus
The distance traveled by the snail each day is now defined by a list.
advance_cm = [30, 21, 33, 77, 44, 45, 23, 45, 12, 34, 55]
On the first day, the snail rises 30cm but during the night it slides 20cm. On the second day, the snail rises 21cm but during the night it slides 20cm, and so on.

1. How many days does it take for the snail to escape the well?
Follow the same guidelines as in the previous challenge.
Hint: Remember that the snail gets out of the well when it surpasses the 125cm of height.

print(max(advance_cm))

2. What is its maximum displacement in one day? And its minimum? Calculate the displacement using only the travel distance of the days used to get out of the well.
Hint: Remember that displacement means the total distance risen taking into account that the snail slides at night.

print(min(advance_cm))

3. What is its average progress? Take into account the snail slides at night.

num = sum(advance_cm)
den = len(advance_cm)
avg =  num / den
print(avg)

4. What is the standard deviation of its displacement? Take into account the snail slides at night.

print(np.std(advance_cm))
print("")
